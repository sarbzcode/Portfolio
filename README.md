```

## üöÄ Setup & Installation
Step-by-step guide:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sarbzcode/Portfolio.git
cd Portfolio
npm install
npm run dev
```
The Vite dev server runs on `http://localhost:5173`. For the contact form, run a compatible `/api/contact` handler (for example `vercel dev`) with the environment variables below before testing submissions. Additional scripts: `npm run build` creates the production bundle, `npm run preview` serves the build locally, and `npm run lint` checks formatting and best practices.

## üîë Environment Variables
Define these in a `.env` file or your Vercel project settings before deploying the contact endpoint:
- `EMAIL_USER` (required): SMTP username or email address sending messages.
- `EMAIL_PASS` (required): SMTP password or app-specific token.
- `EMAIL_HOST` (optional, default `smtp.gmail.com`): SMTP host.
- `EMAIL_PORT` (optional, default `587`): SMTP port number.
- `EMAIL_SECURE` (optional): Set to `true` if SSL/TLS is required.
- `EMAIL_RECEIVER` (optional): Override destination inbox; defaults to `EMAIL_USER`.

## üß≠ Pages & Key Components
- `src/pages/Home.tsx`: Hero profile, skills badges, certifications preview, featured project call-to-action, and embedded contact form.
- `src/pages/About.tsx`: Timeline of initiatives, education highlights, and categorized tech stack badges.
- `src/pages/Projects.tsx`: Case studies for Axepress and ShiftSync with problem, solution, impact, and stack callouts.
- `src/pages/Contact.tsx`: Social contact cards plus the SendMail form.
- `src/pages/Certifications.tsx`: Detailed certification showcase via reusable `Certification` component.
- `src/components/GlyphBackground.tsx`: Canvas-based animated glyph backdrop reacting to theme and pointer movement.
- `src/components/SendMail.tsx`: Validated contact form with async status handling and error messaging.

## üö¢ Deployment
- `vercel.json` configures a static build output from `npm run build` and mounts serverless functions in `api/`.
- `api/contact.ts` uses Nodemailer within Vercel's Node runtime to send messages; production secrets are managed through Vercel environment variables.
- The Vite dev proxy forwards `/api` requests to `http://localhost:5000`, which can be satisfied by `vercel dev` or a local Express adapter during development.
